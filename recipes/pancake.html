      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Japanese Souffle Pancakes are a soft, airy cotton candy-like pancake dream come true. Dress them up in whipped cream or rain down the maple syrup – they come out delicious every which way!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>30 grams of flour</li>
        <li>40 grams of sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons of oil</li>
        <li>½ pack of vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>½ pack of baking powder</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Crack the eggs and put two yolks and half of the sugar in a bowl and whisk together.</li>
        <li>
            Add milk and oil, then mix.</li>
        <li>
            Gradually add the flour, vanilla sugar, and baking powder (preferably through a sieve so that no lumps are formed) and stir everything into a smooth dough.</li>
        <li>
            In a second bowl, beat three egg whites and the remaining sugar with a mixer until stiff.</li>
        <li>
            Gradually add the stiff egg whites to the dough and fold in. <strong>Caution: Do not stir too vigorously</strong> and allow some of the airiness to remain.</li>
        <li>
            Now we move over to the stove. Add some oil in the pan and then — depending on the space — pour in the mixture into small circles. If you have round molds, the pancakes will look nicer, but it still works without them, they just expand a little more.</li>
        <li>
            Bake the pancakes on low heat and add the lid to the pan for about 4-5 minutes. Make sure that the heat is not too strong, otherwise, the pancakes will burn.</li>
        <li>
            Flip the pancakes over and cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            To prevent the pancakes from collapsing, they should be served as soon as possible. They go well with powdered sugar, syrup, chocolate sauce, and fruit.</li>
